Specifically, let's say you select the action UP, you have a probability of 1/3 of actually going UP, 1/3 of going RIGHT and 1/3 of going LEFT. Similarly, if you select LEFT, you have a probability of 1/3 of actually going LEFT, 1/3 of going UP and 1/3 of going DOWN.\n",

        "Use the code given below to run the training loop, where the agent is trained for 200 episodes. The agent we give follows a Q-learning approach, which is an off-policy approach. You will now change the approach to SARSA, which is an on-policy approach. Also, for both Q-learning and SARSA test two different policies: $\\epsilon$-greedy and Softmax. $\\epsilon$-greedy is already defined in the tutorial and implemented in the given agent. Softmax policy refers to sampling the next action following the probability distribution given by $Softmax(Q(s, a))$. We provide you the NumPy softmax function to normalize the Q-Values into a probability function to use before sampling. Similarly to RNN, in the softmax function, there is a temperature value involved, we set a default value that works, but you can tweak it if you find another value with better performance. Report the new value if you decide to do so.\n",
